# Simple Electric Flux Calculator

## Basic Functionality
This is a simple program that allows to calculate the net electric flux through a triangle. And since most computer models are made up of triangles, in theory, you can calculate the net electric flux due to a given system of point charges through any given surface composed of triangles. The simulation is super minimal and bare-bones and requires some additional code for a full setup. Two examples have been provided on its usage.

Moreover, the simulation allows you select how many sub-triangles you use for calculating the flux through a single triangle. Here, the #sub-triangles = $N^2$

## Applications
This simulation can be used to to verify Gauss's Law for Electric Flux, and see that the net electric flux through a closed surface depends only on the net enclosed charge inside the surface, and not on the nature of the closed surface.
